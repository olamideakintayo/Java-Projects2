<h1>TaxCalculator</h1>

<h3>This Java program calculates the tax for citizens based on their earnings. The program asks for the citizen's name and earnings, then calculates the tax based on a simple tax structure:

For earnings up to 30,000, a flat 15% tax is applied.

For earnings above 30,000, the first 30,000 are taxed at 15%, and the excess is taxed at 20%.

The program repeats the process three times for different citizens.

<h1>TheLargestInteger</h1>

<h3>This Java program asks the user to input 10 integers and finds the largest integer among the inputs. It uses a loop to collect the 10 numbers and compare each input to determine the largest one.</h3>
