<h1>This is a Description of the Code in this Repository</h1>

<h1>Difference.java</h1>
<h3>This Java program calculates the difference between two integers, but only if the first integer is greater than the second. The program prompts the user to input two integers and displays the difference if the condition is met.</h3>

<h1>HeadAndTail.java</h1>
<h3>This Java program simulates a coin flip and asks the user to guess the outcome. The user is prompted to enter 0 for heads or 1 for tails, and the program will randomly generate either 0 or 1 to represent heads or tails, respectively. The program then compares the user's guess with the coin flip result and displays whether the guess was correct or incorrect.</h3>

<h1>HigherValues</h1>
<h3>This Java program takes three integer inputs from the user and checks certain conditions regarding the relative values of the integers. Specifically, it checks whether the second integer is greater than the first, and whether the third integer is greater than the second or less than the second.</h3>

<h1>HighestIntegerCount</h1>
<h3>This Java program allows the user to input multiple integers and tracks the largest integer entered along with how many times it has been entered. The program will continue to prompt the user for input until they choose to stop by typing "stop". It will then display the largest integer entered and the number of times it was input.</h3>

<h1>LargestInteger</h1>
<h3>This Java program takes two integer inputs from the user and performs several operations:

It compares the two integers and prints the larger one.

If the integers are equal, it prints 0.

It checks if the integers have the same remainder when divided by 6 and prints the smaller of the two if they do.

If the integers have different remainders when divided by 6, it prints a message indicating that they differ.

</h3>

<h1>MinAndMaxOfInteger</h1>
<h3>This Java program performs several operations on two integers input by the user:

It calculates the sum, product, average, and the absolute distance between the two integers.

It determines and displays the minimum and maximum of the two integers.

</h3>

<h1>PositiveInteger</h1>
<h3>This Java program takes a positive integer as input from the user and prints the multiplication table of that integer, from 1 to 50. </h3>

<h1>PositiveAndNegative.java</h1>
<h3>This Java program takes two integers as input from the user and performs different operations based on the sign (positive or negative) of the two numbers. The operations are:

If both numbers are positive, it calculates and prints their product.

If both numbers are negative, it calculates and prints their product.

If one number is positive and the other is negative, it calculates and prints their sum.</h3>

<h1>ProductsOfIntegers</h1>
<h3>This Java program prompts the user to input two integers and then calculates and prints the product of these two integers. Itâ€™s a simple program that demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and user input handling.</h3>

<h1>RockPaperScissor.java</h1>
<h3>This Java program simulates the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors between the user and the computer. The user is prompted to enter a number between 0 and 2, which corresponds to Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2). The computer randomly selects one of these options, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.</h3>

<h1>RockPaperScissorLoop</h1>
<h3>This Java program extends the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game to a loop where the user can play multiple rounds. The game continues until either the player or the computer wins more than 2 rounds. The scores for both the player and the computer are tracked and displayed after each round, with the final winner determined when one reaches more than 2 wins.</h3>
